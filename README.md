# timer-cool

This is the basic timer function.
Buttons are self explanatory.
Separate button for play, pause and stop.

Improvement needed:

1. Two digits are not displayed once the timer starts. E.g. '9' instead of '09'
2. No method of verification employed for input given - e.g. -4, 1.2 etc. Such cases show distorted result.
3. Hour functionality not added.
4. Play and pause button can be merged into a single toggle button.
