# timer

This is the basic timer function.
Buttons are self explanatory. 
Separate button for play,pause and stop.

Improvement needed:

1. Two digits are not displayed once the timer starts.
2. No method of verification employed for input given - e.g. -4, 1.2 etc.
	such cases show distorted result.
3. Hour functionality not added.
